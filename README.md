# scads (Scala Algorithms and Data Structures)

Eventually, I want this to be a library with a variety of useful
algorithms and data structures in Scala.  For right now, however,
it contains only a single, proof-of-concept trait hierarchy for
[typesafe heaps (priority queues)](src/main/scala/heapTraits.scala) and
a single implementation of those traits as
[leftist heaps](src/main/scala/LeftistHeap.scala).

See a more thorough description of the technical details [here](design/heaps.md).
